Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the process of developing, designing and maintaining software systems.

It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development, design and maintenance of high quality software systems. 



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of Programming Languages (e.g. ForTran C) 

The establishment of Software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s

The advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development cycle involves

Requirements: Gathering Users needs and system requirements

Design: Creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface

Implementation: Writing code and building the software acccording to the design specification

Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards

Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers

Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software 





Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Waterfall Methodology: It is sequential and rigid. It is a stricter methodology which limits a teams ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages of the sofware development cycle. Waterfall has clearly defined expectations and helps the teams avoid expensive changes to a peoject once it has started. Waterfall focuses on reducing wastes within an operation

While, Agile Methodology is flexible and iterative emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. It gives teams a margin of flexibility at each stage of the software development cycle. This allows for early identification and mitigation of issues through its iterative nature.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
